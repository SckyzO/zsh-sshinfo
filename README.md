# üîå Zsh SSHInfo Plugin

A simple Zsh plugin that displays resolved SSH connection details (like the final hostname, port, user, and proxies) before connecting. This is useful for verifying your SSH configuration, especially when dealing with complex setups involving aliases, proxies, or multiple configuration files.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Shows the real `HostName`, `Port`, `User`, and any `ProxyJump` or `ProxyCommand` before connecting.
-   Supports `LocalForward` and `DynamicForward` directives.
-   Automatically aliases `ssh`, `s`, and `connect` to the `sshinfo` function.
-   Gracefully handles hosts that are not found or have configuration errors.
-   Clean, colorized output for better readability.
